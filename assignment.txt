1.  What Is javaScript ? :-
 
>>>    INTRIDUCTION :-

          JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several
          websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that
          enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.

>>>    DEFINITION :-
 
           JavaScript is a scripting language for creating dynamic web page content.
           It creates elements for improving site visitors' interaction with web pages, such as dropdown 
           menus, animated graphics, and dynamic background colors.

2.   What Is The Use Of Is NaN Function ? :-

     >>    JavaScript, NaN is short for "Not-a-Number". 
     >>    In JavaScript, NaN is a number that is not a legal number. 
     >>    The Number isNaN() method returns true if the value is NaN , and the type is a Number.

      . EXAMPLE :-

         let x = Number.NaN;
         let x = NaN;
     
      .DESCRIPTION :-

      >>     In JavaScript, NaN is short for "Not-a-Number".
               In JavaScript, NaN is a number that is not a legal number.
               The Global NaN property is the same as the Number.Nan property.

3.   What Is Negative infinity ? :-

      Negative Infinity is a special numeric value that is returned when an arithmetic operation or 
      mathematical function generates a negative value greater than the largest representable number in 
      javaScript.
      JavaScript displays the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity .

      . EXAMPLE :-

     >>   the variable smallNumber is assigned a value that is smaller than the minimum value. 
            When the if statement executes, smallNumber has the value -Infinity, so smallNumber is set to a
            more manageable value before continuing.

       let smallNumber = -Number.MAX_VALUE * 2;

       if (smallNumber === Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY)
       {
            smallNumber = returnFinite();
       }
